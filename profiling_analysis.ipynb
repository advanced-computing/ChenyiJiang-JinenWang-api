She was obliged to spend all her savings to buy food and other things she needed.  She started her small business, which has been moving forward because of her devotion and perseverance.  She got credits from FSMA in the past and successfully repaid a loan.  Cecilia is requesting a new loan to enlarge her business.  She wants to buy more raw materials to prepare bread with ‘manba’.

He has been a welder for the last ten years.  He worked for a boss who trained him in welding for eight years. Two years ago, Joseph decided to establish his own metal workshop.  He said that the demand for metal doors and windows has increased over the years because of the upsurge of armed robberies.  He is not able to meet all the orders placed by customers because he is limited by inadequate working capital and too little equipment.  That is the main reason why Joseph needs the loan.    He wants to buy more machines, welding equipment and materials so as to increase his production. If he is successful, he wants to erect his own house. Joseph is very enthusiastic and hardworking.",
